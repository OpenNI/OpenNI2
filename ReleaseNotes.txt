Notes:
------
- On Android, only native support (and samples) is currently provided. Please note that as bionic (Android linker) does not
  support the rpath option, the samples cannot start as is. To solve this, do one of the following:
  - Copy OpenNI libraries (libOpenNI2.so, libPS1080.so and libOniFile.so) to /system/lib (requires root) - or -
  - run `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` before starting the native executeable
